This code was writen with the Processing IDE found at www.processing.org (free download)
this code is open source and you can use it as an example or barrow the code for your own projects
I just ask that you point credit to this github profile. (It did take some work to write)
The textures were generated with CharasEX. If you want to run the code from source you will need to download
and install the library "Sprites" for processing. (https://code.google.com/p/sprites4processing/downloads/list)
